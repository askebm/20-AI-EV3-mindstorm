Goal is to follow line. Followed by detecting a cross (start of new tile/node), incrementing global counter,
and continue going straight.

Routine to check cross detection

Color sensors BOTH change value reflecting that they have seen the black lines denoting a cross.
    increment global counter



At the end of the routine (the follow line and go straight routine) global counter should be reset
